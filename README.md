<h2>About</h2>

Specio is a PBR Minecraft texturepack that uses the default texture as specular map, leading to strange, yet beautiful visuals.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

You can use this pack on both <b>Fabric</b> and <b>Forge</b>, however make sure you have those mods installed:

<h4>For Fabirc:</h4>

 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api">Fabric API</a></li>
  <li><a href"https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium">Sodium</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/iris">Iris</a></li>
 </ul>

<h4>For Forge</h4>
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.optifine.net/home">Optifine</a><br><p>(make sure you have the "Specular Mapping" setting in "Shaders" settings menu set to ON)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Shaders</h2>

<p>It's recommended to use a shader alongside the pack since without one it will look just vanilla.
The ones that better suit my taste with this pack are <a href="https://modrinth.com/shader/kappa-shader">Kappa by RRe36</a>, <a href="https://modrinth.com/shader/bliss-shader">Bliss by Xonk</a> and <a href="https://modrinth.com/shader/noble">Noble by Belmu</a>.</p>
<p>Other shaders I can recommend are <a href="https://wiki.shaderlabs.org/wiki/Shaderpacks">VXPT by Zombye</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/55469048">Chronos by Jessie</a>, but only for screenshots since they are not meant to be used for gameplay.</p>
